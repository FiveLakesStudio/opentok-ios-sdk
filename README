OpenTok iOS SDK

This package contains what you need to get you started using the OpenTok iOS SDK.

The OpenTok iOS SDK lets you use OpenTok video sessions in apps you build for iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch devices. This means you can use OpenTok video sessions that connect iOS users with each other and with web clients. For information on OpenTok, see http://http://www.tokbox.com/.

Documentation of the SDK is available here: 

http://www.tokbox.com/opentok/ios/docs/index.html

See the topic on "Getting Started with the OpenTok iOS SDK."

Also, look at the OpenTokHelloWorld sample in the sample directory. This is the simplest sample app. Then look at the OpenTokBasic sample, which uses more of the API.

Support is available at the OpenTok forums: http://www.tokbox.com/forums/
